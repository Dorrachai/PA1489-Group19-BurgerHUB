CHANGED GROUP

17/9
We have decidedas group have decided to work with the assignment twice
a week - Tuesdays and Thursdays. We're will use VsCode. There's one 
person who hasn't shown up yet. We decided to give the person another
chance to join on Thursday. Today, we're looking into how to link to a 
repository on GitHub:
    - Each time you want to upload something, you need to pull first
    before you can push
    - Git add .
    - Git commit -m "message"
    - Git push origin (branch name)

19/9
We created a Discord server for group communication. We tried to commit
files to Git but failed.

24/9
Transferred the assignment description to README.md; will refine it later

CHANGED GROUP

8/10
First meeting with the new group:
They have made a lot of progress, and I'm keeping up as best as I can.
I've been added to their GitHub and have cloned the repository. I created
my own branch using the command git branch -c "name". Then used 
git switch "branch name" to switch to that brand. I've created my own 
menu for my burger and have been granted access to commit to the GitHub repository. I've added a picture, burger to menu csv and html for krabbypatty
