CHANGED GROUP

17/9
We have decidedas group have decided to work with the assignment twice
a week - Tuesdays and Thursdays. We're will use VsCode. There's one 
person who hasn't shown up yet. We decided to give the person another
chance to join on Thursday. Today, we're looking into how to link to a 
repository on GitHub:
    - Each time you want to upload something, you need to pull first
    before you can push
    - Git add .
    - Git commit -m "message"
    - Git push origin (branch name)

19/9
We created a Discord server for group communication. We tried to commit
files to Git but failed.

24/9
Transferred the assignment description to README.md; will refine it later

CHANGED GROUP

8/10
First meeting with the new group:
They have made a lot of progress, and I'm keeping up as best as I can.
I've been added to their GitHub and have cloned the repository. I created
my own branch using the command git branch -c "name". Then used 
git switch "branch name" to switch to that brand. I've created my own 
menu for my burger and have been granted access to commit to the GitHub repository. 
I've added a picture, burger to menu csv and html for krabbypatty

9/10
A merge issue occurred in Git that caused the frontend branch to malfunction. 
After investigating, we decided to delete the problematic branch and create a new one.
Locally, I removed the previous branch and repository from my computer and performed 
a fresh clone to ensure everything was in sync. 
Commands used:
git add ,to stage files
git commit ,to commit the changes with appropriate messages
git status ,to track current state of the working directory

10/10
I created a stylesheet for the order success page, using 'inherit' to apply the 
same font as the 'parent file'. I made changes in the routes to ensure the page renders. 
I'm working on centering the order success text. I managed to move it by using margin to remove 
the spacing.
