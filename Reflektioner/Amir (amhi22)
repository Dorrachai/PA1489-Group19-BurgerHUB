Today I got acces to the course, we created a group with three individuals and started planning how we wanted to approach and complete our assignment. We made a teello card where
we could add things that needed to be done and tick off things that we had completed, in trello we also divided up the project into different responsobility areas. Giving
each person some part to be responible for, our reason behind this was not for one person to complete an entire area alone but just to have someone making sure all areas
are managed and the work for the area is devided equally amoung all three of us.
After deciding our IDEs we started setting up everything we needed like a github repo where we all could make pull and push requests from. I could not get the git commands to work at first
but managed to solve it a bit after.


19/9
Today we started working on the project we answered the questions in Assignment 1 and started making our menu for our project "BurgerHub". We did some more reasearch into
the different IDEs and softwares we had choose for the project. Then started to tick off the diffent questions that we completed in trello.
We all made our own burger and added drinks and sidedishes to eachothers burgers by pushing to the github repo and letting
the another person take over so that everyone contributed to the menus and everyone pushed and pulled from the github repo.

Today we were unsure if we were on the correct path or not, so we contacted the teaceher to help clarify
our questions. We were on the right pass so we started working on assignment 2 and the setup for our database and docker.

23/9
This was the officail start for assignment 2 we sat toghether in ericsson labs and did some programing together, i was mostly focused on setting up the database we were going to use for the assignemnt. I have had a lot of problems with github authentication but cloned the repository again and it seems to be working again.

fix db creation

9/10
Today we started by trying to fix the error with inserting from our csv file into the db. We found the error to be that for some reason whenn the db is created it doesnt allow local infile. This was perventing us from inserting, to work around this we added a mysql cnf file that runs when the docker is started which tells the db to allow local infile. This worked on two of our machinces but not all, we later discovered that there seemed to be a problem with the terminals. When docker was run on ubuntu and mac terminals it worked fine but when run on gitbash it did not work. We found why gitbash didnt like it and soolved it aswell. After this we were able to continue work on the functionallity of the program making it so that when you choose burger you are prompted with a new page that lets you edit your order such as choose sides, drinks and toppings.

9/11
Today i continued on the work commited by one of the other group memebers finishing the save order function which adds the users oder to the db. We added to the already exsisting function by making it so that it also saves the specific toppings chosen and not just side and drinks. We started working on the kitchen view as well making a new file and adding the nesisary code for outputting the orders. We made it so that everytime a new order comes in we print the entire orders table so we can see all the orders that are waiting to be completed. We also added to the order success screen making it so that when you place an order you get a confirmation message and you order number promted on screen.
