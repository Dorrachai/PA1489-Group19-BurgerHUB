Today I got acces to the course, we created a group with three individuals and started planning how we wanted to approach and complete our assignment. We made a teello card where
we could add things that needed to be done and tick off things that we had completed, in trello we also divided up the project into different responsobility areas. Giving
each person some part to be responible for, our reason behind this was not for one person to complete an entire area alone but just to have someone making sure all areas
are managed and the work for the area is devided equally amoung all three of us.
After deciding our IDEs we started setting up everything we needed like a github repo where we all could make pull and push requests from. I could not get the git commands to work at first
but managed to solve it a bit after.

Today we started working on the project we answered the questions in Assignment 1 and started making our menu for our project "BurgerHub". We did some more reasearch into
the different IDEs and softwares we had choose for the project. Then started to tick off the diffent questions that we completed in trello.
We all made our own burger and added drinks and sidedishes to eachothers burgers by pushing to the github repo and letting
the another person take over so that everyone contributed to the menus and everyone pushed and pulled from the github repo.

Today we were unsure if we were on the correct path or not, so we contacted the teaceher to help clarify
our questions. We were on the right pass so we started working on assignment 2 and the setup for our database and docker.

I have had a lot of problems with github authentication but cloned the repository again and it seems to be working again.
