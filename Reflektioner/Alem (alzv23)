Diary for Alem Zvirkic

This is my first time working with git and github but so far there has not been any major complications.
I like the fact that you can use branches so that you can always go back to the working clean code.
We have planned ahead and set deadlines so we have a plan and what needs to be done when.
Some commands in git that I learned today that are useful: git commit -m"" , git push origin "branch"

Today I started on some menus and let the other people, edit them and it works. I also updated our trello with more specific goals that need to be done. Definitely getting more used to Git and GitHub now and having less trouble.
