Diary for Alem Zvirkic
-------------------------------

09/18
I found a group and started working, I also got registered to the course later then other students hence why I did not start sooner or find a group sooner.
This is my first time working with git and github but so far there has not been any major complications.
I like the fact that you can use branches so that you can always go back to the working clean code.
We have planned ahead and set deadlines so we have a plan and what needs to be done when.
Some commands in git that I learned today that are useful: git commit -m"" , git push origin "branch"

09/19
Today I started on some menus and let the other people, edit them and it works.
I also updated our trello with more specific goals that need to be done.
Definitely getting more used to Git and GitHub now and having less trouble.

09/20
Done with start of part 1 we checked with the teacher to see if we were on the right path and that we were.

09/23
We started with assignment 2 today, we sat in group and did some programming.
and were successful in doing so. We also started on the docker.

09/24
We spent most of the time today on the docker so it would work. It took some time and debugging but we managed to get it working in the end.

09/26
We started making the website with routes, views and such.

09/27


09/30
We started making the edit order page but encounterd problems with the database

10/01
Countined debugging the database

10/02
Fixed description for the burgers

10/03
Managed to get the docker to work again with the place order page but the database was still empty

10/07
The placeorder website stopped working again since it said that the tables were empty

10/08
We got a new groupmember today
Managed to fix the docker again so it starts and also figuerd out why the database did not work. The database is now created and works, the tables are also created and works last thing is to fix the insert I managed to get it working with manully running the command on my pc but when I run with docker the tables are empty seems to be a problem with the local_infile. Will try to fix it tmrw we should be done soon.
