Diary for Alem Zvirkic
-------------------------------

I found a group and started working, I also got registered to the course later then other students hence why I did not start sooner or find a group sooner.
This is my first time working with git and github but so far there has not been any major complications.
I like the fact that you can use branches so that you can always go back to the working clean code.
We have planned ahead and set deadlines so we have a plan and what needs to be done when.
Some commands in git that I learned today that are useful: git commit -m"" , git push origin "branch"

Today I started on some menus and let the other people, edit them and it works.
I also updated our trello with more specific goals that need to be done.
Definitely getting more used to Git and GitHub now and having less trouble.

Done with start of part 1 we checked with the teacher to see if we were on the right path and that we were.
