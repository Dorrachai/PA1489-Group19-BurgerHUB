views/: Contains EJS templates for front-end rendering.
routes/: Handles routes for ordering and order processing.
config/: Stores configuration files, including database settings and Docker configuration.
Configuration Management
BurgerHub uses Git for version control and Docker for environment management, which ensures consistency across different setups. Configuration files, including Docker Compose, handle dependencies and the MySQL database setup.

Docker
Containers: There are two main containersâ€”one for the application and one for the MySQL database.
Database Initialization: SQL scripts in docker-entrypoint-initdb.d run automatically to set up and populate the database when the container starts.
Local Infile Setup: Docker automatically configures local-infile for MySQL, ensuring that file imports are supported as needed.

Testing
Manual Testing:
Place orders through the web interface and verify the order data in the database.

Automated Testing:
Run npm test to execute Jest tests for back-end functions.
Cypress can be used for end-to-end testing of the user interface.
